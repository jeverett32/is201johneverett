                                As a current business student at Brigham Young University at Provo, pursuing a degree in Information Systems, I have always been obsessed with technology in coding. My passion started pretty early on when I would watch my dad and brother code for school and work. I though it was the most intriguing thing in the world. I decided to take a python class at my highschool my senior year and fell in love. I decided that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 
                                <br><br>
                                My first year of college, I was a Computer Science major, and it deepened my passion for coding and the possibilities of it. After leaving school and serving a 2 year, full-time mission in Brazil, I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do with my life. I had many different ideas come into my head, and I met so many people that did drastically different thing, each with its own charm. But my thoughts always came back to programming. After my mission, I transferred to BYU and am now working my hardest to learn all I can about the possibilities of coding. When I'm not doing coursework or working at my two jobs, I am learning new skills and working on personal projects, like this website. It excites me, and drives me to continue.
                                <br><br>
                                I love the outdoors, my family, and playing volleyball. I have experience doing summer sales for Lumio and being a sales and customer service representative at State Farm. I currently work as a research assistant and a fast-food manager and am pursuing a career in software development and data analytics.
